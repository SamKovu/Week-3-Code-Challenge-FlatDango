# Week-3-Code-Challenge
FlatDango

## Built With:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON Server

## Projects Description:

Modify FlatDango HTML Website with Javascript to achieve deliverables.

### Required Deliverables Done

 1. See the first movie's details, including its **poster, title, runtime,
   showtime, and available tickets** when the page loads. The number of
   available tickets will need to be derived by subtracting the number of
   `tickets_sold` from the theater's `capacity`.
   
 2. See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page in the `ul#films`
   element when the page loads
   
 
 3. Buy a ticket for a movie. After clicking the "Buy Ticket" button, I should
    see the number of available tickets decreasing on the frontend. I should not
    be able to buy a ticket if the showing is sold out (if there are 0 tickets
    available). 


### Bonus Deliverable Done

 1. Click on a movie in the menu to replace the currently displayed movie's
   details with the new movie's details. Note that you may have to make an

   additional GET request to access the movie's details.


## Usage:
Require running json-server --watch db.json from target folder prior
to opening html file.
